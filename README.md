To avoid problems with Jupyter using the wrong version of Python, it is recommended to install Python dependencies in a virtual environment and launch Jupyter from within that environment. This will ensure that the correct version of Python and packages are being used.

- `pyenv install 3.8.6`
- `pyenv virtualenv 3.8.6 geospatial`
- `pyenv activate geospatial`
- `pip install --upgrade pip `
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `jupyter lab`
- Open the analysis notebooks
